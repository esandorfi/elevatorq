# Elevator Q

by Emmanuel Sandorfi  
Answering to the Wave.ai Coding Exercise Goals

---

For this challenge, I had really **three iterations to clarify the specifications before starting to code**.
Insights takes time. My goal is to contain the coding timeframe in a maximum of two business days, and get a POC ready to use and exchange.

3). **[Third iteration with the duo of the Product Manager and the Engeneering](docs/iter3/readme.md)** : **GO FOR IT !**  
We simplify the second iteration, and focus on the result we want : optimize ux and keep the look algo. Have fixed use cases for the elevators fleet. We keep the technology : python, django, orm, javascript. 
 
2). [Second iteration with the Engeneering and after the Product Manager](docs/iter2/readme.md) :  *not choose.*  
We select here a standard elevator system, with a standard LOOK algortyhme, with an api server architecture, with bots to simulate people and elevators, and the goal of TV summary of the lifts queue. Possible but too long. 
 

3). [First iteration mainly as first a Product Manager](docs/iter1/readme.md) : *not choose.*  
We thought of a dispatch elevator system, but makes it highly too complicated to produce in this timeframe.
