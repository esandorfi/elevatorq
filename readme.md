# Elevator Q

by Emmanuel Sandorfi  
Answering to the Wave.ai Coding Exercise Goals

---

For this challenge, I had really **three iterations to clarify the specifications before starting to code**.
Insights takes time. My goal is to contain the coding timeframe in a maximum of two business days, and get a POC ready to use and exchange.

## Go for it

[**Third iteration** : duet Product Manager and Engineer](docs/iter3/readme.md) : *APPROVED*  
We simplify the second iteration, and focus on the result we want : optimize UX, keep the LOOK algorithm, fixed use cases for the elevators fleet. We keep the technology : python, django api, javascript.

## Drafts

[**Second iteration** : first Engineer, after Product Manager](docs/iter2/readme.md) :  *canceled*  
We select here a standard elevator system, with the LOOK algorithm, with an api server architecture, with bots to simulate people and elevators, and the goal of TV summary of the lifts queue. Possible but too long. 
 

[**First iteration** : mainly Product Manager, ask the Engineer](docs/iter1/readme.md) : *canceled*  
We thought of a dispatch elevator system, but makes it highly too complicated to produce in this timeframe.
