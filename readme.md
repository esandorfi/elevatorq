For this coding challenge, We had really **three iterations to clarify the specifications before starting to code**. Insights takes time. Our goal is to contain the coding timeframe in a maximum of two business days, and get a POC ready to use and exchange.

We simplify the control system, and focus on the result we want : optimize UX, keep the LOOK algorithm, fixed use cases for the elevators fleet. We use this stack : python, django server api, javascript.

**[1) Check the specifications](docs/iter3/readme.md)**

**[2) Go for an online demo : elevatorq.herokuapp.com](http://elevatorq.herokuapp.com)**

## Drafts

[**Second iteration** : first Engineer, after Product Manager](docs/iter2/readme.md) : _canceled_  
We select here a standard elevator system, with the LOOK algorithm, with an api server architecture, with bots to simulate people and elevators, and the goal of TV summary of the lifts queue. Possible but too long.

[**First iteration** : mainly Product Manager, ask the Engineer](docs/iter1/readme.md) : _canceled_  
We thought of a dispatch elevator system, but makes it highly too complicated to produce in this timeframe.
